## Project Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based system designed to predict drug‚Äìtarget interactions by estimating the binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) between drug molecules and proteins. We integrate a **Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)** for molecular graph encoding and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for protein sequence embedding. The model aims to accelerate early-stage drug discovery by identifying promising drug candidates more efficiently.

---

## Problem Statement
A major bottleneck in drug development is identifying how strongly a drug molecule binds to a target protein. The **dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>)** quantifies this binding; lower values indicate stronger interactions. Accurately predicting K<sub>d</sub> values allows researchers to eliminate weak binders early, reducing experimental costs and speeding up drug screening.

## Methodology

### üîπ 1. Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)
- Converts drug SMILES into molecular graphs using RDKit.
- GIN is used to extract structural features due to its superior expressiveness over GCN/GAT.

### üîπ 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Encodes the protein sequences into meaningful embeddings.
- Captures local patterns and motifs in amino acid sequences.

### üîπ 3. Feature Fusion & Prediction
- Drug and protein embeddings are concatenated.
- Fully connected layers are used to predict binding affinity.

## Dataset
We used the **DAVIS dataset**, a benchmark dataset for drug-target binding prediction containing:
- Drug-protein pairs
- Binding affinities (K<sub>d</sub>) as regression targets

## Results

| Metric              | Value     |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Training Accuracy   | 88.8%     |
| Test Accuracy       | 87.8%     |
| RMSE (Test)         | *Add Here* |
| MAE (Test)          | *Add Here* |
| Pearson Correlation | *Add Here* |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: Accuracy is only meaningful if K<sub>d</sub> is binned into classes. Please include regression metrics if you're treating K<sub>d</sub> as continuous.*
