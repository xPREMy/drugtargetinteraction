Project Overview
This project presents a deep learning model designed to accurately predict drug-target interactions, specifically focusing on the binding affinity between drug molecules and target proteins. By integrating Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this model aims to enhance the efficiency of early-stage drug discovery by identifying potent drug candidates.

Problem Statement
A critical challenge in drug discovery is precisely determining how strongly a drug molecule binds to its target protein. The dissociation constant (K_d) is a key indicator of this binding strength; a lower K_d signifies stronger binding. Accurate prediction of K_d is essential for identifying effective drug candidates and eliminating weak binders early in the drug discovery pipeline, thereby accelerating the overall process.

Methodology
Our model employs a hybrid deep learning architecture:

Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN): Utilized to encode the structural information of drug molecules. Molecular graphs are generated from SMILES representations, and GIN processes these graphs, leveraging its superior ability to distinguish different graph structures compared to other Graph Neural Network (GNN) models like GCN and GAT.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Used to process the sequential information of target proteins.

Feature Concatenation: Features extracted from both the GIN (molecular graph embeddings) and the CNN (protein sequence embeddings) are concatenated.

Prediction Layer: The combined features are then fed into a fully connected layer to predict the binding affinity (K_d).

Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated using the DAVIS dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for drug-target interaction prediction.

Results
The model demonstrated robust performance on both training and testing splits:

Training Set Accuracy: 88.8%

Test Set Accuracy: 87.8%

These results indicate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting drug-target binding affinities.
